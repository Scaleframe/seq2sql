# Translating Complex Natural Language Questions into SQL Queries: an extension of Seq2SQL

This repo is an adaption of the implementations of SQLNet and Seq2SQL neural networks for predicting SQL queries on [WikiSQL dataset](https://github.com/salesforce/WikiSQL). The paper is available at [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04436). 
This was part of a larger research project with the Yale Computer Science LILY Lab [Spider: A Large-Scale Complex Human-Labeled SQL Corpus for Semantic Parsing and Text-to-SQL Generation](https://yale-lily.github.io/bibtex/spider.txt), which will be presented at EMNLP 2018.
